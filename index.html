		<h1>A Look at Under-Five Mortality Rates</h1>
			<h2 class="subtitle">IS THE WORLD IMPROVING?</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<p>Twenty-Five years ago, the Convention on the Rights of the Child brought the high <span class="orange-bold">under-five mortality rates</span> to the world's attention. The under-five mortality rates refer to the number of deaths for children under five years of age per 1,000 live births. Since 1990, many changes have been made towards the issue, but the Millenium Development Goal - to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 - has still not been achieved. </p>

				<h3>Global Under-Five Mortality Rates in 2015</h3>
					<p>Based on the April 2015 UNICEF progress report, there is an estimated 5.9 million under-five deaths in 2015. Some areas have much higher under-five mortality rates than others. Sub-Saharan Africa has the most severe cases of high under-five mortality rate compared to the rest of the world.</p>

				<p>Malawi has the highest percentage decline, 73.6%, in under-five mortality rate since 1990. In 1990, Malawi had the sixth highest under-five mortaltiy rate in the world at <span class="cyan-bold">242.4</span> deaths per 1,000 live child births. By 2015 it has lowered it's under-five mortality rate to <span class="cyan-bold">64</span> deaths per 1,000 live child births.</p>
