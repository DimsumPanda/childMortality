			<h2 class="subtitle">A Look at Child Mortality Rates</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<p>Twenty-Five years ago, the Convention on the Rights of the Child brought the problem of child-mortality to the world's attention. Since 1990, many changes have been made, but the Millenium Development Goal - to reduce the mortality rate of children under five years of age by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 - has still not been achieved. However, there has still been significant progress and the global under-five mortality rate has fallen by 53 percent since 1990.</p>

			<h3>Sub-Saharan Countries with the highest...</h3>
				<p>Due to the efforts in the past quarter century, many of the Sub-Saharan Countries with the highest under-five mortality rates have significantly declined. Decline in child mortality rate is the percentage decline from 1990 to 2015 in Under-five mortality in the particular country.</p>
			<h3>Malawi</h3>
				<p>Malawi has the highest decline in under-five mortality rate since 1990. It has experienced a 73.6% decline. In 1990, Malawi had the sixth highest under-five mortaltiy rate in the world at <span class="cyan-bold">242.4</span> deaths per 1,000 live child births.
